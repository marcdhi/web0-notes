# Notes: doc.rust-lang.org

Here are concise yet comprehensive study notes on Variables and Mutability in Rust:

## Variables and Mutability

### Immutable Variables
- Variables are **immutable** by default
- Cannot change value once bound to a name
- Prevents bugs from changing values unexpectedly

```rust
let x = 5;
x = 6; // Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

### Mutable Variables
- Use `mut` keyword to make variables **mutable**
- Allows changing the value bound to the variable

```rust
let mut x = 5;
x = 6; // Allowed: x is mutable
```

### Constants
- Declared with `const` keyword
- **Immutable** by nature
- Type **must** be annotated
- Set to **constant expression** (computed at compile-time)
- Naming convention: **ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES**

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

### Shadowing
- Introduce a new variable with the same name
- New variable **shadows** the previous one
- Allows changing the value and type of a variable

```rust
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1; // Shadows and rebinds x to 6

{
    let x = x * 2; // Inner scope, x is 12
    println!("x is: {x}"); // Outputs 12
}

println!("x is: {x}"); // Outputs 6 (outer scope)
```

- Prevents accidentally reassigning an immutable variable
- Avoids need for different names for variables of different types

### Key Points
- **Immutability** is the default for safety and easy concurrency
- Use `mut` for mutability when needed
- **Constants** are always immutable
- **Shadowing** introduces a new variable, doesn't mutate existing one
