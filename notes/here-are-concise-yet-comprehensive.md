# Notes: here-are-concise-yet-comprehensive

Here are concise yet comprehensive study notes on Variables and Mutability in Rust, based on the provided webpage content:

## Variables and Mutability

### Immutable Variables
- Variables are **immutable** by default
- Cannot change value once bound to a name
- Promotes safety and easy concurrency
- Example:
```rust
let x = 5;
x = 6; // Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

### Mutable Variables
- Use `mut` keyword to make a variable mutable
- Allows changing the value bound to the variable name
- Example: 
```rust
let mut x = 5;
x = 6; // Allowed, x is now 6
```

### Constants
- Declared with `const` keyword
- **Immutable** by nature, cannot use `mut`
- Value must be a **constant expression**
- Type must be **annotated**
- Naming convention: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Example:
```rust 
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

### Shadowing
- Declare a new variable with the same name as previous
- New variable **shadows** the previous one
- Allows changing value and type of a variable
- Example:
```rust
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1; // Shadows previous x, now x = 6

{
    let x = x * 2; // Inner scope, x = 12
    println!("x = {}", x); // Prints 12
}

println!("x = {}", x); // Prints 6 (outer x)
```

### Key Points
- **Immutability** by default for safety
- Use `mut` to make variables mutable
- **Constants** are always immutable
- **Shadowing** allows reusing variable names
